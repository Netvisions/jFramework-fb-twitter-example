jFramework-fb-twitter-example
=============================

This is just something I developed to learn more about the JoomlaFrameWork and how to code a Command-Line-Application using Composer and all the cool stuff kids play with at the moment. I used some existing data and tables (yes I am lazy).

Don't expect support or new versions, this is only for learning.

To get it running you need a Facebook App Id, that's easy to get only a few clicks. You need also a database table to get the account data, there is a table.sql you can use to create the table.

Installation:
* Clone it
* run composer
* configure 
	* config_fb.json
	* configuration.php
